# Univeral Time Display Version 2
Second version of the glorified clock, no longer discriminates against anyone who isn't in the BST/GMT timezones!

## Next Update features:
## Features:
> 1. See different times using buttons on the left of the screen!
> 2. Change the bars in the middle of the window to view other times too!
> 3. A simple widget which can display in the bottom-right corner of your screen!
> 4. Feature to allow your current time to be shown on your discord profile!
> 5. Can collapse to your system tray (for when you want your discord rich presence to be shown without your window being open)
> 6. Uses the modern .NET 5 framework!
> 7. This is literally just an over-engineered clock, i have no idea what else to say lmfao
